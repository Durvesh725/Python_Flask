 INTRODUCTION
---------------

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 

In other words, OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text. OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible. The subprocesses are:

- Preprocessing of the Image
- Text Localization
- Character Segmentation
- Character Recognition
- Post Processing
